1. When evaluating idea, think in terms of best case scenario ie. what if opponent allows u to do what u wanna do?
2. Need to prioritise 



## Tactics
1. Pins are a 2 way street. The piece which pins the opponent’s piece if undefended can be vulnerable as well.
2. Silman insists that combinations cannot exist without one or more of the following present:

- A weakened (or open) King. When a King has poor pawn cover, has no defenders, or is otherwise weak, a combination is prob­ ably in the works.
- A stalemated King. When a King has no legal moves, tactics that produce check also result in checkmate.
- Undefended pieces (not pawns). Any unguarded piece is sub­ject to destruction by a double attack or fork.
- Inadequately guarded pieces. Such a piece appears to be safe, but a sudden double attack can place the piece in jeopardy by adding another attacker.



### Mistakes when doing puzzles

1. Do not get tunnel visioned ie. just look at one part of the board.
2. When a single piece is suporting many pieces, look for deflection tactics.
3. Always look for unsupported pieces,pawns in puzzles.
4. Look out for ideas on pieces whose movement has been restricted.
5. Do not sac pieces just for it, but be clear about the idea for the sac.
6. For every move, however obvious, question purpose and check if any other way to accomplish the same; if yes, check those possibilities as well.
7. Be clever, Try dumb stuff.

1. Tactics are learnt by combining 2 things-> Calculation and Pattern Recognition to find and recognise patterns.
2. Try to learn 4-5 positions everyday.
3. Not necessary to do difficult puzzles; do unrated ones from a certain range for enough time to learn most of the patterns at that level.
4. Start doing puzzles with a time limit of about 60 secs; once you find a puzzle you aren't able to do, look at the solution and go through it mentally thrice.
5. Do this for 5 puzzles everyday.
