## Design Requirements

- 




- Typography needs to be serious(or casual?)
- fuck it let's make it casual. 
- colour scheme?
- reinventing the wheel in a positive sense. It means it can be improved by making small changes.
- just a plain colour in background is not good. I need some random shades of given colour but they need to change within a margin. This will most closely replicate what occurs in real life.!
	- check out perlin noises and worley noises.
	- Also checkout procedural sky generation and noise modulated gradient. 
- Garamond or dancing script font.
- message conveyed by website should be that writing everyday makes a huge difference. Also writing environment should be made as calm as possible. So blue should be used. 



## interesting things
- fractal patterns are ever repeating shapes. 
	- this includes the **mandelbrot set** 
	- and **sierpienski triangle**.
- Ink paintings in Japan called **sumi**-e or **suibokuga**.
- apart from that Japanese calligraphy is called as **shodo**.
