## Finding the lowest cost

- Instead of trynna find the minima mathematically, we can adjust the slope according to its value to make the output lower. If I can recall a bit of calculus, if slope is positive then we shift the value to right and to left if slope is negative.
- Optimization -> We can make the changes in slope proportional the slope value, then when slope is flattening out, then steps become smaller and smaller and hence it prevents overshooting.


- Now imagine this for more than one variable. In this case, it becomes a 3D, 4D space etc and so on. The visualization of that is not important right now. What needs to be understood is that the gradient descent gives the direction of steepest increase.
