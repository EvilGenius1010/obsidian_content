## Strategy
>[!BREAK GLASS] If many contributors in your orgs, find orgs in feb, march which are not being contributed to.

#### Luck 
- Find organisations with not a lot of contributors.
- To be done after list is released.
- Try impressing them with your contributions from last 3 months and over contribute there.

#### Effort
- Usually effort based.
- Most need core C++/Encoding/Rust knowledge.
- Number of selections very high.


## Timeline
15 November ->Find 1-2 organisations.
1st Dec ->Setup codebase and talk to maintainers.
Feb->Organisations announced.
March-> Create a proposal.
April -> Keep contributing until results are out.
