# Normalisation

- It is the process of organizing a database to reduce dependency and redundancy. 
- It is done by splitting the table into smaller tables which follow specific rules known as **normal forms** like 1NF, 2NF,3NF etc.


## 1NF

Rules are as follows
- All columns must contain indivisible values.
- All values inside a column must contain data of a single datatype.
- All 1NF tables should have a primary key.
