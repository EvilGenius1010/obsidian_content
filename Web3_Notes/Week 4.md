## Why SOL and ETH?

- Ppl started creating their own blockchains after BTC to fit their own usecases.
- This resulted in some blockchains being less secure than BTC due to having less miners to secure the network(also called the cold start problem).
- ETH was introduced with aim of allowing ppl to `deploy their usecases onto the ETH blockchain` using smart contracts. Solana is also working in the same way.

## Account Model Solana

- Accounts can
    - Store money
    - Store data
    - Be executable
- Lamports is the native currency in SOL. $1\ SOL = 10^9\ lamports$

## Rent

- Rent is a mechanism to ensure efficient usage of resources on the blockchain.
- Rent works in two ways
    - If your rent is more than a certain amount, then you are rent exempted and no lamports are debited from your account.
    - If not above a certain threshold, some amount of rent is continuously debited from your account.
